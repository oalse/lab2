    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, 
        interpreted programming language that conforms to the
        ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also
        characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based 
        and multi-paradigm. Alongside HTMI and CSS, JavaScript
        is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide
        Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus 
        is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority 
        of websites use it, and all major web browsers have a 
        dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications 
       (NCSA), a unit of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 
       released NCS.A Mosaic, the first popular graphical Web browser,
       which played an important part in expanding the growth of the
       World Wide Web. In 1994, a company called Mosaic Communications 
       was founded in Mountain View, California and employed many of
       the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic Netscape. 
       However, it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic.
       The internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla.
        The first version of the Web browser, Mosaic Netscape 0.9,
        was released in late 1994. Within four months it had already 
        taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main 
        web browser for the 1990s. The browser was renamed Netscape 
        Navigator in the same year, and the company took the name 
        Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications realized
        that the Web needed to become more dynamic. In 1995, 
        Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun Microsystems 
        to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static
        programming language Java, in order to compete with
        Microsoft for user adoption of Web technologies and
        platforms. Netscape Communications then decided that
        the scripting language they wanted to create would
        complement Java and should have a similar syntax.
        To defend the idea of JavaScript against competing 
        proposals, the company developed a prototype named
        Mocha. Later it was renamed JavaScript when it was
        deployed in the Netscape Navigator 2.0 beta 3 in
        December. The final choice of name caused confusion,
        giving the impression that the language was a spin-off of 
        the Java programming language, and the choice has been 
        characterized as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give
        JavaScript the cachet of what was then the hot new Web
        programming language.</p>
